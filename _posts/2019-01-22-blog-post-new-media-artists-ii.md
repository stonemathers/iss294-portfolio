## LIA - Tentasho

Tentasho is a procedural software work created by LIA. It includes both an interactive and automated mode. In the interactive mode, the user can generate there own works using a touch screen. There are a series of parameters that the user can adjust to modify Tentasho's output. In the automated mode, the program explores the ranges of the various paramters, automatically creating works of its own. I was drawn to the work's balance of minimalism and complexity. Parameters are few and interaction is simple, making it easy for anybody to create their own works. Yet, these work are incredibly complex and detailed. Tentasho was shown at the Yokyerler / Nonspaces exhibition in Akbank Sanat, Istanbul, Turkey from 12/16/2016 - 3/4/2017.

## Natalie Sun & Joshua Davis - Citizen Rose

As a one-night event in LA, Natalie Sun and Joshua Davis put together an interactive projection in a parking lot in downtown LA. The public was enticed by projections of works by Davis. Questions were then projected, asking audience members to describe a person based on singular actions. An audience member would say this descriptor into a lone mic, set up in the middle of the lot, at which point the word would be projected onto the screen. Slowly, the words cloud together to create an image of Rose McGowan, the actress and activist who brought to light the abuses of Harvey Weinstein and, as a result, received considerable social media backlash. I was especially drawn to this piece by its live nature and overall message.
