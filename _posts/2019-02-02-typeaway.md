For this piece, I wanted to maintain the heavily interactive component of my first sketch. I felt that the mouse movement of the first sketch made interaction feel less natural, so I removed that aspect, instead positioning letters randomly. I wanted to emphasize more the idea of streams of information flying across the screen. Thus, I display the letters in a line. To maintain the feelings of confusion and disorientation from the first sketch, I randomized the size, speed, color, direction, and font of the displayed letters. Even the font of the title screen (added to hint at the piece's necessary interaction) is randomized with each page load. For the fonts, I wanted to pick a diverse set of fonts that mimic the different sources of information that flood our screens daily. I also wanted some of the to be reminiscent of pop culture such as video games, comic books, and samurai movies. For the colors, I decided to no longer entirely randomize them. Instead, each letter gets one color that it maintains as it slowly fades out. This fixed the potentially seizure-inducing aesthetic of the first sketch, but kept bright colors that stood out against the black landscape, void of information.
