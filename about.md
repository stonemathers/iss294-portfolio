Stone will be graduating this spring with a major in Computer Science. Outside of the classroom, he is a section leader and snare player in the Duke Drumline, a drum set player in the Pep Band, and the president of Duke Club Running. He is also the project manager of the [Book of Fortresses](https://www.dukewired.org/projects/the-book-of-fortresses/) project in the Wired Lab, a space for pursuing research in digital art history and visual culture. Following graduation, I will be working in New York City as a software engineer at Yext.
